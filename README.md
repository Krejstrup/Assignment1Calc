# Assignment1Calc
This ia a small first Assignment in .Net Core C#.

The task is to make a small and simple calculator in an console. So a textbased calculator.

The main task is to understand the fundamentals of C# and how to write a simple console application.


Required Features:

 • The program should be able to perform basic mathematical operations (Math has methods for more advanced operations if you include them).
 
  o Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication, etc…
  
 • The program should keep running until the user chooses to end it.
 
Code Requirements:

 • Each mathematical operation should be in its own method.
 
  o Division should inform the user if they try to divide by zero.
  
 • Use a loop and a menu system to keep the program running.
 
 This program was refactored to use testings with xUnit.
 
 Thank you!
